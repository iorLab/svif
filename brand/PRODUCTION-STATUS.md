# Svif brand production status

Date: 2026-09-02
Branch: `brand/identity-system`
Canonical Project ref remains: `main`

## Locked input

The Principal-approved Today 10:42 AM Svif board is the sole Svif-only visual authority. See `APPROVED-VISUAL-REFERENCE.md` and `reference/EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.md`.

## Completed

- concept exploration ended;
- approved visual reference locked by exact source SHA-256;
- rejected deterministic v0.1 reconstruction removed from the active branch;
- lossless source-board crops prepared for primary mark, wordmark, horizontal/vertical lockups, light/dark/monochrome examples, app-icon example, and social-card example;
- crop coordinates and derived hashes persisted for reproducible trace/QA;
- raster-board limitation recorded: board labels such as `512px` are presentation labels, not proof that a true 512px source asset exists;
- `brand/masters/candidates/svif-wordmark-trace-v0.1.svg` contains a raster-derived trace candidate of the approved standalone `Svif` wordmark;
- `brand/tools/derive-raster-assets.py` now provides a deterministic white-matte extraction path for approved white-background crops, producing transparent PNG derivatives plus a SHA-256 manifest;
- local QA of that raster path preserves the approved Svif appearance on white while recovering usable transparency for the mark/lockups; 128/64/32/16 icon derivatives have been visually checked;
- the derivation manifest explicitly marks outputs larger than the native approved crop as raster-derived upscales rather than pretending they are native source masters.

## Current production gate

**Faithful vectorization remains the master gate.**

A vector master may be accepted only when it is traced/reconstructed from the approved crop and visually compared with that crop. No new image generation, generic S replacement, typography substitution, palette reconciliation, or aesthetic cleanup is allowed.

The raster derivation tool is an interim/reproducible production path, not permission to redefine the master. It exists so exact approved appearance can be used without waiting for an inferior SVG reconstruction.

### Candidate status

- Wordmark trace: **candidate only**. Geometry is derived from the locked raster reference and has been iteratively tightened; it is not yet promoted to a master.
- Primary S mark: **blocked from vector-master promotion**. Automatic contour/quantization, layered-gradient, and superpixel/SLIC experiments all preserve the broad silhouette but introduce visible posterization, faceting, or particle/ribbon drift. Those experiments remain rejected from the branch master set.
- Raster primary/lockup derivation: **reproducible candidate path**. White-background source appearance is retained and transparency can be recovered deterministically; this does not make the result a vector master.
- Lockups and final variants: vector versions remain blocked until the primary mark and wordmark pass the master gate.

The quality rule is explicit: **absence of a vector master is preferable to a visually drifting vector master.**

## Binary reference boundary

The byte-exact approved board and crop PNGs remain preserved by SHA-256 and in the locked local reference package. They are not falsely claimed to be repository binaries. The current connector can create Git blobs from supplied base64 text, but there is no direct local-file upload bridge; final binary preservation should be completed on a Git-capable execution surface before `main` integration.

## Next actions

1. Continue faithful reconstruction of the Svif primary S, preserving ribbon layering, translucency, silhouette, and particle trajectories without posterization or visible faceting.
2. Run visual regression on the current wordmark candidate and revise only where the locked raster demonstrates a mismatch.
3. Use `brand/tools/derive-raster-assets.py` for reproducible interim transparent/icon derivatives once the approved crop files are present on the execution surface; keep upscale flags intact.
4. Reconstruct horizontal and vertical vector lockups only after both primary mark and wordmark are accepted masters.
5. Build light/dark/monochrome vector variants only from locked masters and the approved examples.
6. Run target-size QA for repository, app, favicon, and social surfaces.
7. Before final integration, preserve the byte-exact approved source in repository storage, re-resolve latest `main`, reconcile Agnir continuity, and integrate coherently.
